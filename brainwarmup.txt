It depends on how often we want to change the content of the course:

if the course contents dont change for a long time, we should keep the files already zipped cause:

1) it take less storage space
2) less time to download files
3) although we need more processing power, its like using a powerful machine for less time as compared to less powerful machine for a long time

but if the course content change frequently, the professor has to keep unzipping and zipping the files, which will put a lot of load on the server. So i think it will be better to keep the file unzipped as 
1) the students can select the files which they want to zip.
2) easier to change content
3) much lower computational power requireds
